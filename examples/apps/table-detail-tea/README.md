# Table detail view

This example shows how to create a table of items and a detail view.

It uses the Elm architecture or TEA approach as described on [the ratatui website](https://ratatui.rs/concepts/application-patterns/the-elm-architecture/).

To run this demo:

```shell
cargo run -p table-detail-tea
```
